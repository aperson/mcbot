mcbot.sh

This script is intended to interface with a minecraft server running in an
existing screen session like the one provided by the server startup script
that is on the minecraft wiki.

INSTALLING

Copy the mcbot.sh , motd, and help files to the folder your server resides
on.

Edit the motd file to suit your server's needs.

Edit the $SPATH varialbe in the mcbot.sh to reflect the directory that the
server/mcbot are installed to.

This script requires lynx to be installed if you want /weather to work.

RUNNING

mcbot can be run manually from a terminal, but if you go this route, remember
that mcbot will stop itself when the minecraft server stops and that you'll
have to restart it every time the server stops. It's recommended that you set
mcbot to run with the server.  If you use the server startup script mentioned
above, this is easy.  Just add something like (the & is crucial!):

as_user "$MCPATH/mcbot.sh" &

I recommend adding this after the:

as_user "cd $MCPATH && screen -dmS minecraft $INVOCATION"

in the mc_start function.

USAGE

The commands are (as from the help file)

/help            - shows this message
/list              - shows online players
/tp user        - teleports to user
/get item [x]    - gives you item of x amount
/motd            - shows the motd
/weather zip   - gets the weather for zip


If you're wondering what /weather is doing in there, well, BECAUSE, that's why.
Anyways, /get is only set up to give netherrack, glowstone, and soulsand .  It's
my server's belief that the only items that should be spawned are nether items,
so that's all my script provides.  If you're ambitious enough, this is easy enough
to edit to add in more items.  And yes, I know soul sand is two words, but it's
easier to parse it as one word :) .


I don't know how this file went from trying to be impersonal to what it ended up
being, but who knows?

This script is intended to be basic.  Suggestions/comments are welcome.
