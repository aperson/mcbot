##A minecraft server bot for vanilla servers.##

This script is intended to work with a vanilla server running in a screen session.  If you do not know what that is or how to set it up, I recommend you learn how or turn away.

Currently, this bot provides the following commands/services:

*  Message Of The Day.

*  Notifies users of online players on login.

*  Provides /list for non-ops.

*  Provides /help to show available commands.

*  Provieds /tp to allow player-to-player teleportation.

*  Provides /seen to query the last logged in time of a user.

*  [Currently disabled/removed] Provides /get for nether items on servers that do not have the nether enabled.  Has daily allowances.

*  [Todo] Will provide a /mail system to leave short messages for users.
